Corner taking and scoring.
In swinging corners you have more chance of scoring off.
The ball is attacking the net, all you need is a touch on the ball and a goal.
A lofted straight ball for instance, you jump and need to put power in a header over a curved ball in.
you can score straight off a bent ball in.
An out swinger your on the back foot not ideal for scoring less chance of scoring over an in swinger.
in swinger with wind for instance, rip it in, the fear in the opponents head.
